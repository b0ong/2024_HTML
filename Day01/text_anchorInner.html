    동해물과 백두산이 마르고 닳도록 하느님이 보우하사 우리나라 만세
    Certainly! The music industry these days is undergoing some fascinating changes.
    With the advent of streaming services, the way we listen to music has completely transformed. Rather than purchasing entire albums or CDs, it's now common to listen to music song by song or through playlists.
    This presents new opportunities for the music industry while also posing unique challenges for musicians.
    Additionally, the methods of creating music and the formats of music are evolving.
    With the advancement of artificial intelligence and technology, there's also been innovation in music production.
    However, traditional music isn't disappearing; instead, it's being combined with new technologies to create diverse musical experiences.
    These changes suggest an exciting era for music lovers, where a variety of musical experiences are possible
